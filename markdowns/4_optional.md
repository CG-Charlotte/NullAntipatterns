# Optional
Java 8 also includes a nifty new class which was made specifically to manage *missing* values. It is effectively a wrapper class which contains either an instance of the given class, or a null value. It is therefore possible to manipulate null values as if they were normal instances without necessarily having to perform a null check at every step.
