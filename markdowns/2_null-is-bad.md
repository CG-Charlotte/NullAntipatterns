# The Easiest way to manage null

The easiest way to manage null is sometimes to not use it. 
Java coders tend to acquire the habit of initializing data (attributes & variables) to null.
This puts them at risk of using a method on the null object thus causing an amazing runtime exception to be thrown!

It's generally a better idea to use an empty type to initialize data, and yields the same results as a cumbersome null check.


## Empty Collections
We are frequently tempted to initialize a collection to null to represent the fact that it has not been given any data yet. Making it necessary to instantiate it at a liter time.

Why not instatiate it straight away?

This will prevent a potential NullPointerException at runtime and free us of the chore to check if it is null before we try to access it. Moreover, every collection has an `Ã¬sEmpty()` method which is as easy to manipulate as anything.

## Empty String

The other kind of data often initialized to null is `String`.
But for the exact same reasons we should prefer to use an **empty string** to replace `null`.

If you want to make it as clear as possible, you can declare a constant in your code such as:
```Java
public final String EMPTY_STRING = "";
```
But many coders prefer to use an external library. The Apache Common Lang defines many usefull methods for String manipulation, as well as an alias for an empty String.

```Java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;

public String name = StringUtils.EMPTY;
```
